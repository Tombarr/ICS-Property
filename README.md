Description:
-------

With version 4.0 ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich) Google introduced a new API, the Property class (http://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Property.html). This is a port made from the leaked Galaxy Nexus system dump of the Property API which works on ANY Android version.    
A property is an abstraction that can be used to represent a mutable value that is held in a host object. The Property's set(Object, Object) or get(Object) methods can be implemented in terms of the private fields of the host object, or via "setter" and "getter" methods or by some other mechanism, as appropriate.
